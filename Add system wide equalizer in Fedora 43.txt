Run to check type of audio server:
pactl info | grep "Server Name"

Mine was:
Server Name: PulseAudio (on PipeWire 1.4.9)
This means I'm running PulseAudio.

sudo dnf install easyeffects lsp-plugins
easyeffects

Add appropriate EQ Effect. It runs lsp-plugins in the background. You can import a Equalizer APO config here.
