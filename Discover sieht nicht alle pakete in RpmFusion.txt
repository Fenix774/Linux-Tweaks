AppStream metadata

RPM Fusion repositories also provide Appstream metadata to enable users to install packages using Gnome Software/KDE Discover. Please note that these are a subset of all packages since the metadata are only generated for GUI packages.

For the current Fedora releases: the suggested method is to install appstream-data using DNF.

    The following command will install the required group of packages:

    sudo dnf update @core

     * Since DNF5 (Fedora 41 and later), the Fedora groups cannot be extended by RPM Fusion, so you need to mention the package explicitely:
    sudo dnf install rpmfusion-\*-appstream-data
